# Did you know?
Dragon Dragon Fire Fire is a difficult game. Here are some gameplay tips to help you reach higher scores:

-By shooting while holding "up", you can shoot fireballs into the air.
-You can drop down from thin platforms by pressing "jump" while holding "down".
-Falling off the bottom of the screen won't cost you a life. Instead, you'll wrap around and appear at the top again. You can exploit this to tactically traverse the stages.
-Enemies that are already burning immediately get incinerated when hit by another fireball. Try to aim for enemies that already caught fire or hit them with two fireballs in quick succession to finish them off faster.
-The key to not running out of time in later stages is to be efficient with your time in the earlier ones. Improve your path through the stages even if you've already mastered them to save precious seconds for later levels.

Dragon Dragon Fire Fire is coming to Steam as a Deluxe version in 2026, featuring more stages, more enemies, 2 player local co-op and online leaderboards! Wishlist now!
